# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Primary focused on C++ & Python

### Why these languages?

#### Python

- Python is very simple, yet powerful in doing complicated tasks in few lines of code
- Python has a lot of built-in functionality with many library functions and data structures such as a deque

#### C++

- C++ is a language that I've always been fond of, I've never learned it formally in school
- C++ can really help understand the inner-workings of Python, sort of what's behind the scenes

#### What's in here?

- Foundations of DSA
- My daily leetcode problems
- Advanced Algorithms
- Algorithms / Problems implemented from class
